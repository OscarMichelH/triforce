### Summary
Experience using Rails and Ruby:
I started around 2017 with Rails, I remember installed in my local the last version of Rails 3, but I started formally with version 4. I learned to write code in C++, but when I found ruby, I switch it to my main lenguage for any project where ruby or Rails framework was allowed.
In my first hackaton without knowledge yet of git tools or another things I developed with a friend a gem to document code:
https://github.com/OscarMichelH/Martha

My first scholar projects were in Ruby/Rails for example:
- For advanced database class: https://github.com/OscarMichelH/miniMedic (https://mini-medic.herokuapp.com/)
- For software arquitecture class: https://github.com/OscarMichelH/design_patterns
- For IA class: https://github.com/OscarMichelH/Optimizacion-De-Pozos---Simulated-Annealing
- For Web Development class: https://github.com/OscarMichelH/falcon-mx (https://falcon-mx.herokuapp.com/)
- Even whit a partner/friend for my final career project I created an Object Oriented Programming Lenguage using ruby: https://github.com/OscarMichelH/Food-LOOP

Then from my graduation I started to develop systems to independent clients, for example:
- Ox School Mty - restful notifications app to consume from a mobile app (Last public version: https://github.com/OscarMichelH/oxford-app-api)
- Partido MORENA NL - System to save and account the votes of NL state elections
- Safe Solutions Abogados - Complete tracking case system

Others:
- My own site in Rails: oscarmh.com
- Personal project (Feel free to use). A site where you can make your financial balance sheet and track assets and liabilities. https://balansee.herokuapp.com/

What do you think about the language or framework?
I love the rails philosophy, personally is my favorite web framework, because it allows create an MVP very quickly, and abstract the business rules in a technological solution, and the main lenguage ruby is very simple and minimalist, but at the same time very advanced. If develop software is art, ruby is my favorite art tool / brush / chisel / instrument, etc.

What is your sense of working primarily in a Ruby team?
I see future in Rails so, the increase of the use in the market is awesome, as I mentioned I started in the version 3-4 and now we are getting the version 7, that means that is constantly improving parallel to my professional growth. Is a perfect tool to implement the old software engineering knowledge for example design pattern, but also is able and adapt to use the new tools and approaches in the market, for example the new UI/UX frameworks, or new discovered patterns.
